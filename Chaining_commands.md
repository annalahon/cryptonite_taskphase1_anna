## Module 11: Chaining Commands

- ### Chaining with Semicolons

Using `;` works similar to separating 2 commands into 2 different lines. It executes the first command first and when it terminates, it executes the command after the `;`.

- ### Your First Shell Script

Used [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-shell-script-in-linux/) to learn how to make the shell script and write in the commands.

- ### Redirecting Script Output

Similar to before challenge, but while using `bash` to run the script, we pipe the output to `/challenge/solve` directly.

- ### Executable shell scripts

Small change by making the shell script executable, hence not using bash to invoke it.
