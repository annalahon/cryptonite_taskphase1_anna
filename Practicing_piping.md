- ### Redirecting output

Using `>` to redirect the output **PWN** to the **COLLEGE** file

- ### Redirecting more output

Here, we redirect the output of `/challenge/run` which is the flag, to the file **myflag**

- ### Appending output

Here, `/challenge/run` writes the first half of the flag directly to the file when using `>`. For the second half, we need to use `>>` to append the second half into the same file.

- ### Redirecting errors

In this challenge, we redirected the instructions of the `/challenge/run` command to the **instructions** file and the output to the **myflag** file, giving us the flag.

- ### Redirecting input

First we redirect the ouput **CHALLENGE** into the **PWN** file. This file input is then redirected to `/challenge/run` by using `<`

- ### Grepping stored results
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee8b93be-609e-4458-8c0b-2a7d2b9360a7)
Here, we first redirect the output of `/challenge/run` to the file `/tmp/data.txt` and then `grep` that data to get the flag.

- ### Grepping live output

We can directly redirect output and grep the input in one line by using the `|` pipe operator. Here, we grep the output of `/challenge/run` to get the flag.

- ### Grepping errors
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b6fb6ba-c391-4ad4-8f16-101726ae6a4d)
Here, we are using `2>&1` to redirect the standard error to standard output and then grepping the combined stderr and stdout to get the flag.

- ### Duplicating piped data with tee
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf734f88-10ef-4cd5-9a6f-c10ed651e0af)
Used `tee` to intercept pwn and get its secret code and pipe it into `/challenge/college`

- ### Writing to multiple programs
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dbcadf6-6e53-4be7-a4df-4514fb4e5816)
Using `tee >()` we can write the command output as input to the respective programs

- ### Split-piping stderr and stdout

Using `2>` and `>()` together to pipe stderr while using `1>` and `>()` to pipe stdout and getting the flag in the process.
